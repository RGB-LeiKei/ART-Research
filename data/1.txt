The project “Learning about the History of the Netherlands through ART: Augmented Reality Tutor” aims to explore how AI-supported augmented reality can improve the learning process. Instead of relying solely on traditional reading or lectures, this experiment focuses on how ART can make studying more interactive, engaging, and personalized. The goal is to discover whether ART helps users understand complex topics more deeply while keeping them motivated. By applying it to the topic of Dutch history, the project investigates how technology can combine factual accuracy, conversational learning, and visual elements to create a modern educational experience that feels more like dialogue than study.
