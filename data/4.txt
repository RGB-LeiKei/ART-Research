During the exploration phase, users interacted with the platform through three main methods: text-based chat, avatar conversation, and voice communication. Each mode offered a slightly different experience, from typing questions to speaking directly to a digital avatar. Registration was required before starting, which functioned properly but could be simplified by adding a guest access option. Once inside, the system provided an intuitive interface that was easy to navigate and visually appealing. The conversational design helped make users feel more at ease, transforming the learning process into something friendly and approachable rather than strictly academic or mechanical.
