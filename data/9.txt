Customization was identified as another key area for improvement. Users learn differently, and having the ability to adjust the platform to their preferences could greatly improve the learning experience. Options like selecting between concise or detailed responses, changing the avatar’s voice or appearance, or even adjusting the color scheme could make the system more personal and adaptive. Personalization not only makes the interface more comfortable but also encourages longer engagement. If learners can shape how information is presented to them, ART could become more than a tool — it could become a personalized tutor that adapts to each user’s unique learning style.
