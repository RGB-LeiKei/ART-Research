One of ART’s most innovative features is its transparency system, which flags uncertain or unsupported claims with a “hallucination” mark. This allows users to see which parts of a response are based on verified data and which are assumptions or incomplete knowledge. Such honesty is rare in educational technology and contributes significantly to user trust. Instead of pretending to be all-knowing, ART shows its limitations openly, helping learners understand where further research might be needed. This approach not only improves credibility but also promotes a healthy, questioning attitude toward digital information sources.
