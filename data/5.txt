The quality of ART’s responses depended greatly on how the user phrased their questions. When prompts were vague or too general, the answers tended to be short and lacked detail. However, when questions were specific, the AI produced richer, more precise explanations. For instance, a broad question about the Dutch Golden Age might yield a general overview, while a focused one about Christian Huygens’ contributions to navigation would bring detailed insights. This behavior revealed an important aspect of AI learning tools: they encourage users to think critically about how they ask questions, indirectly teaching better research and communication skills.
