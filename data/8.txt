Based on the findings, several improvements were proposed to enhance the ART learning experience. First, expanding the knowledge base would help the AI provide deeper and more nuanced information. Second, adding guest access could attract new users by removing registration barriers. Third, improving contextual awareness would allow ART to remember previous questions and create more natural, continuous conversations. Additionally, increasing response speed would make interactions smoother, keeping users engaged. Each of these enhancements would bring ART closer to being a powerful and reliable learning companion, capable of balancing educational depth with accessibility and fun.
