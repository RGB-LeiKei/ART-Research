Before the experiment began, the team created a clear plan defining what to test and how to evaluate it. The chosen topic was the “History of the Netherlands,” and several criteria were established for assessment: clarity, usefulness, engagement, accuracy, and aesthetic quality. Clarity measured how understandable ART’s explanations were; usefulness focused on whether it helped users learn effectively; engagement examined how well it captured attention; accuracy evaluated historical correctness; and aesthetic quality looked at how visuals and design supported learning. Setting these standards ensured that the study would not only test ART’s technical performance but also its educational value and user experience.
