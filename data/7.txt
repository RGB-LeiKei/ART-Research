When the results were analyzed, ART showed impressive performance in engagement and user satisfaction. The combination of conversation, visuals, and voice made learning feel enjoyable and human-like. However, some weaknesses were identified, including slower response times, occasional vagueness in explanations, and limited access to reference materials. The platform’s minimalist design worked well, offering a clean and uncluttered interface that supported focus. Its strongest advantage was interactivity — students stayed curious and continued exploring topics. Still, for deeper academic use, ART would need more detailed content and faster, more context-aware dialogue handling.
