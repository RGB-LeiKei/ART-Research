The project demonstrated that ART can make studying history more dynamic, interactive, and enjoyable. Rather than just presenting facts, the platform allows learners to explore topics conversationally, ask follow-up questions, and receive contextual explanations. Its transparency about uncertain information builds trust, while the mix of text, visuals, and voice creates a balanced educational experience. Although there are still areas for improvement — such as expanding content, improving responsiveness, and offering more customization — ART already proves that AI-driven augmented reality can successfully transform traditional learning into an engaging dialogue between technology and curiosity. It stands as a promising step toward the future of education.
