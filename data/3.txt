The topic served as both a content base and a test case for ART’s educational capability. The history of the Netherlands is rich and diverse, involving major historical movements, global trade, innovation, and cultural growth. Using ART, participants explored this history through conversations with an AI avatar capable of explaining historical events and figures interactively. This approach transformed passive reading into a dynamic experience where students could ask questions, clarify doubts, and explore subtopics at their own pace. It reflected a shift from memorization to understanding — allowing users to connect with history in a more personal and meaningful way.
